# # FastAI model training with Weights & Biases and Gradio
#
# This example trains a vision model to 98-99% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
# and then makes this trained model shareable with others using the [Gradio.app](https://gradio.app/)
# web interface framework.
#
# Combining GPU-accelerated Modal Functions, a network file system for caching, and Modal
# webhooks for the model demo, we have a simple, productive, and cost-effective
# pathway to building and deploying ML in the cloud!
#

#
# ## Setting up the dependencies
#
# Our GPU training is done with PyTorch which bundles its CUDA dependencies, so
# we can start with a slim Debian OS image and install a handful of `pip` packages into it.

# also not large, about 150MB, so we don't bother persisting it in a network file system
# and just download and unpack it to ephemeral disk.

# ## Training a vision model with FastAI
#
# To address the CIFAR-10 image classification problem, we use the high-level fastAI framework
# to train a Deep Residual Network (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) with 18-layers, called `resnet18`.
#
# We don't train the model from scratch. A transfer learning approach is sufficient to reach 98-99%
# accuracy on the classification task. The main tweak we make is to adjust the image size of the CIFAR-10
# examples to be 224x224, which was the image size the `resnet18` model was originally trained on.
#
# Just to demonstrate the affect of the image upscaling on classification performance, we still train on
# the original size 32x32 images.
#
# ### Tracking with Weights & Biases
#
# ![weights & biases UI](./wandb-ui.png)
#
# Weights & Biases (W&B) is a product that provides out-of-the-box model training observability. With a few
# lines of code and an account, we gain a dashboard will key metrics such as training loss, accuracy, and GPU
# utilization.
#
# If you want to run this example without setting up Weights & Biases, just remove the
# `secret=Secret.from_name("wandb")` line from the Function decorator below; this will disable Weights & Biases
# functionality.
#
# ### Detaching our training run
#
# Fine-tuning the base ResNet model takes about 30-40 minutes on a GPU. To avoid
# needing to keep our terminal active, we can run training as a 'detached run'.
#
# `MODAL_GPU=any modal run --detach vision_model_training.py::stub.train`
