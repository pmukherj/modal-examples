# # Write to Google Sheets
#
# In this tutorial, we'll show how to use Modal to schedule a daily update of a dataset
# from an analytics database to Google Sheets.
#
# ## Entering credentials
#
# We begin by setting up some credentials that we'll need in order to access our database and output
# spreadsheet. To do that in a secure manner, we log in to our Modal account on the web and go to
# the [Secrets](/secrets) section.
#
# ### Database
#
# First we will enter our database credentials. The easiest way to do this is to click **New
# secret** and select the **Postgres compatible** secret preset and fill in the requested
# information. Then we press **Next** and name our secret "analytics-database" and click **Create**.
#
# ### Google Sheets/GCP
#
# We'll now add another Secret for Google Sheets access through Google Cloud Platform. Click **New
# secret** and select the Google Sheets preset.
#
# In order to access the Google Sheets API, we'll need to create a *Service Account* in Google Cloud
# Platform. You can skip this step if you already have a Service Account json file.
#
# 1. Sign up to Google Cloud Platform or log in if you haven't
#    ([https://cloud.google.com/](https://cloud.google.com/)).
# 2. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
# 3. In the navigation pane on the left, go to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.
# 4. Click the **+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT** button.
# 5. Give the service account a suitable name, like "sheet-access-bot". Click **Done**. You don't
#    have to grant it any specific access privileges at this time.
# 6. Click your new service account in the list view that appears and navigate to the **Keys**
#    section.
# 7. Click **Add key** and choose **Create new key**. Use the **JSON** key type and confirm by
#    clicking **Create**.
# 8. A json key file should be downloaded to your computer at this point. Copy the contents of that
#    file and use it as the value for the **SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON** field in your new secret.
#
# We'll name this other secret "gsheets".
#
# Now you can access the values of your secrets from modal functions that you annotate with the
# corresponding EnvDict includes, e.g.:

import os

import modal

stub = modal.Stub("example-db-to-sheet")


@stub.function(secret=modal.Secret.from_name("postgres-secret"))
def my_func():
    # automatically filled from the specified secret
    print("Host is " + os.environ["PGHOST"])


# In order to connect to the database, we'll use the `psycopg2` Python package. To make it available
# to your Modal function you need to supply it with an `image` argument that tells Modal how to
# build the container image that contains that package. We'll base it off of the `Image.debian_slim` base
# image that's built into modal, and make sure to install the required binary packages as well as
# the psycopg2 package itself:

pg_image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim().apt_install("libpq-dev").pip_install("psycopg2")
)

# Since the default keynames for a **Postgres compatible** secret correspond to the environment
# variables that `psycopg2` looks for, you can now easily connect to the database even without
# explicit credentials in your code. We'll create a simple function that queries the city for each
# user in our dummy `users` table:


@stub.function(
    image=pg_image,
    secret=modal.Secret.from_name("postgres-secret"),
)
def get_db_rows():
    import psycopg2

    conn = psycopg2.connect()  # no explicit credentials needed
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("SELECT city FROM users")
    return [row[0] for row in cur.fetchall()]


# Note that we import psycopg2 inside our function instead of the global scope. This allows us to
# run this Modal function even from an environment where psycopg2 is not installed. We can test run
# this function using the `modal run` shell command: `modal run db_to_sheet.py::stub.get_db_rows`.

# ## Applying Python logic
#
# For each city in our source data we'll make an online lookup of the current weather using the
# [http://openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org) API. To do this, we'll add the API key to
# another modal secret. We'll use a custom secret called "weather" with the key
# `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` containing our API key for OpenWeatherMap.

requests_image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install("requests")


@stub.function(
    image=requests_image,
    secret=modal.Secret.from_name("weather-secret"),
)
def city_weather(city):
    import requests

    url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
    params = {"q": city, "appid": os.environ["OPENWEATHER_API_KEY"]}
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    weather_label = response.json()["weather"][0]["main"]
    return weather_label


# We'll make use of Modal's built-in `function.map` method to create our report. `function.map`
# makes it really easy to parallelise work by executing a function for a larger sequence of input
# data. For this example we'll make a simple count of rows per weather type, using Python's
# standard library `collections.Counter`.

from collections import Counter


@stub.function()
def create_report(cities):
    # run city_weather for each city in parallel
    user_weather = city_weather.map(cities)
    users_by_weather = Counter(user_weather).items()
    return users_by_weather


# Let's try to run this! To make it simple to trigger the function with some
# predefined input data, we create a "local entrypoint" `main` that can be
# easily triggered from the command line:


@stub.local_entrypoint()
def main():
    cities = [
        "Stockholm,,Sweden",
        "New York,NY,USA",
        "Tokyo,,Japan",
    ]
    print(create_report.remote(cities))


# Running the local entrypoint using `modal run db_to_sheet.py` should print something like:
# `dict_items([('Clouds', 3)])`.
# Note that since this file only has a single stub, and the stub has only one local entrypoint
# we only have to specify the file to run - the function/entrypoint is inferred.

# In this case the logic is quite simple, but in a real world context you could have applied a
# machine learning model or any other tool you could build into a container to transform the data.
#
# ## Sending output to a Google Sheet
#
# We'll set up a new Google Sheet to send our report to. Using the "Sharing" dialog in Google
# Sheets, we make sure to share the document to the service account's email address (the value of
# the `client_email` field in the json file) and make the service account an editor of the document.
#
# The URL of a Google Sheet is something like:
# `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wOktal......IJR77jD8Do`.
#
# We copy the part of the URL that comes after `/d/` - that is the *key* of the document which
# we'll refer to in our code. We'll make use of the `pygsheets` python package to authenticate with
# Google Sheets and then update the spreadsheet with information from the report we just created:

pygsheets_image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install("pygsheets")


@stub.function(
    image=pygsheets_image,
    secret=modal.Secret.from_name("gsheets-secret"),
)
def update_sheet_report(rows):
    import pygsheets

    gc = pygsheets.authorize(service_account_env_var="SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON")
    document_key = "1RqQrJ6Ikf611adKunm8tmL1mKzHLjNwLWm_T7mfXSYA"
    sh = gc.open_by_key(document_key)
    worksheet = sh.sheet1
    worksheet.clear("A2")

    worksheet.update_values("A2", [list(row) for row in rows])


# At this point, we have everything we need in order to run the full program. We can put it all together in
# another Modal function, and add a [schedule](/docs/guide/cron) argument so it runs every day automatically:


@stub.function(schedule=modal.Cron("0 0 * * *"))
def db_to_sheet():
    rows = get_db_rows.remote()
    report = create_report.remote(rows)
    update_sheet_report.remote(report)
    print("Updated sheet with new weather distribution")
    for weather, count in report:
        print(f"{weather}: {count}")


# This entire stub can now be deployed using `modal deploy db_to_sheet.py`. The [apps page](/apps)
# shows our cron job's execution history and lets you navigate to each invocation's logs.
# To trigger a manual run from your local code during development, you can also trigger this function using the cli:
# `modal run db_to_sheet.py::stub.db_to_sheet`

# Note that all of the @stub.function() annotated functions above run remotely in isolated containers that are specified per
# function, but they are called as seamlessly as using regular Python functions. This is a simple
# showcase of how you can mix and match functions that use different environments and have them feed
# into each other or even call each other as if they were all functions in the same local program.
